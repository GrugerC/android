Android project examples

These Android apps are to demonstrate my ability and knowledge. They are created by me and have been influenced by what I've learned in the MOOC specializaion on Coursera "Mobile Cloud Computing with Android". I credit Professors Adam Porter of University of Maryland, Douglas Schmidt and Jules White of Vanderbilt University and their course TAs with helping a Java programmer with no Android experience become competent in the span of a year.
